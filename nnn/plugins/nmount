# Description: Toggle mount status of a device using pmount
#              If the device is not mounted, it will be mounted.
#              If the device is mounted, it will be unmounted and powered down.
#
#              Runs `lsblk` if 'l' is entered, exits on 'Return`.
#
# Note:
# - The script uses Linux-specific lsblk to list block devices. Alternatives:
#       macOS: "diskutil list"
#       BSD: "geom disk list"
# - The script uses udisksctl (from udisks2) to pwoer down devices. This is also Linux-specific.
#   Users on non-Linux platforms can comment it and use an alterntive to power-down disks.
#
# Shell: POSIX compliant

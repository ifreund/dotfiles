# Output configuration
#
    output * bg $base03 solid_color
#
# Idle configuration
#
    # Example configuration:
    #
    # exec swayidle -w \
    #          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
    #          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' \
    #               resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
    #          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
    #
    # This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
    # your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
    # resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

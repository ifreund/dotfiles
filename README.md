# Isaac Freund's dotfiles

This is my relatively minimal configuration for [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and [Sway](https://swaywm.org/)

# Installation

If you would like to try out my dotfiles first install Arch Linux and then give [packages.txt](packages.txt) a read to see the core packages I use.  After the desired packages have been installed, clone this repository and either run `./install.sh` from the repository root or alternatively use the script as documentation as to where the files/directories should be symlinked to if you only wish to try out a subset of my configuration.

I've tried to add comments for my own sake wherever needed, so understanding and tweaking the configuration to your own tastes shouldn't be a problem.

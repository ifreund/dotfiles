# Isaac Freund's dotfiles

This is my relatively minimal configuration for
[void linux](https://voidlinux.org/) and
[river](https://github.com/ifreund/river)

# Installation

Run `./install.sh` from the repository root or alternatively use the script
as documentation as to where the files/directories should be symlinked to
if you only wish to try out a subset of my configuration.

I've tried to add comments for my own sake wherever needed, so
understanding and tweaking the configuration to your own tastes shouldn't
be a problem.
